# To add an entry to this file, an administrator should use the NIS command 
# "newkey" on the Network Information Services master machine.
#
# Users can also insert their own entries into this file using the chkey
# command. Commenting out the "nobody" entry below disallows this feature,
# and chkey will only allow users to change their existing entry, not create
# a new one.
