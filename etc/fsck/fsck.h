 * Linked list of duplicate blocks.
 *
 * The list is composed of two parts. The first part of the
 * list (from duplist through the node pointed to by muldup)
 * contains a single copy of each duplicate block that has been
 * found. The second part of the list (from muldup to the end)
 * contains duplicate blocks that have been found more than once.
 * To check if a block has been found as a duplicate it is only
 * necessary to search from duplist through muldup. To find the
 * total number of times that a block has been found as a duplicate
 * the entire list must be searched for occurences of the block
 * in question. The following diagram shows a sample list where
 * w (found twice), x (found once), y (found three times), and z
 * (found once) are duplicate block numbers:
 *
 *    w -> y -> x -> z -> y -> w -> y
 *    ^		     ^
 *    |		     |
