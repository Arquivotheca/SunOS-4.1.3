/*
**  Check for Condition After a Move
**
**	Various ship conditions are checked.  First we check
**	to see if we have already lost the game, due to running
**	out of life support reserves, running out of energy,
**	or running out of crew members.  The check for running
**	out of time is in events().
**
**	If we are in automatic override mode (Etc.nkling < 0), we
**	don't want to do anything else, lest we call autover
**	recursively.
**
**	In the normal case, if there is a supernova, we call
**	autover() to help us escape.  If after calling autover()
**	we are still in the grips of a supernova, we get burnt
**	up.
**
**	If there are no Klingons in this quadrant, we nullify any
**	distress calls which might exist.
**
**	We then set the condition code, based on the energy level
**	and battle conditions.
