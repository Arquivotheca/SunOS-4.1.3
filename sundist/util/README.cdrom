README for creating a miniroot
1. use "format" to format and/or label the disk as needed 
2. set the variable "disk" to sd0, sd1, xy0 or whatever is appropriate
	example# disk=sd0
3. run the extract script by sourceing it
	example# . /extract
4. when the shell prompts (with "#"), enter:
	reboot XX(0,<UNIT#>,1) -sw
  where "<UNIT#>" is the unit number, ie 0 for sd0, 1 for sd1, etc.
  and "XX" is the disk name "sd" for SCSI, "xy" for SMD, etc.
