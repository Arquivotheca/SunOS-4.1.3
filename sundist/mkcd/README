The cdrom image will be created on a special dedicated machine (with LOTS
of disk spaces and a mounted tape drive)
			
To create cdrom image file , do a "make -f cdimage.mk image" in the 
/usr/src/sundist directory.

To create a set of cdrom image tapes from the created cdrom image file,
do a "make -f cdimage.mk tapes" in the /usr/src/sundist directory.

To dump the cdrom image file onto a scsi disk for internal testing,
do a "make -f cdimage.mk disk" in the /usr/src/sundist directory.
