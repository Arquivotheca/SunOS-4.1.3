Perform the following steps to upgrade from SunOS 4.1.1 or SunOS 4.1.2
to SunOS 4.1.3:

1) Perform a level 0 dump of your system.

2) Be sure your root partition has at least two free megabytes, and that
   /usr has at least eleven free megabytes (necessary if you upgrade the full 
   set of software categories).

3) Mount the the media with SunOS 4.1.3 release on /usr/etc/install/tar

   # mount -rt hsfs /dev/sr0 /usr/etc/install/tar

4) cd /usr/etc/install/tar/sunupgrade/shell

5) [optional] Run sunupgrade with -dummy and -verbose  options to determine
   that the proper software categories will be upgraded. 

   % sunupgrade -d -v [-xVOLATILE_LIST]

6) Run check_perm to see which SunOS 4.1.1 or SunOS 4.1.2 files that are 
   going to be replaced by SunOS 4.1.3 files have been changed since 
   SunOS 4.1.1 or SunOS 4.1.2 was installed.

7) Rename files listed by check_perm or create your own volatile file list,
   if necessary.

8) If you are upgrading a server, halt all client machines.

   NOTE: If you are upgrading the server of dataless clients, upgrade each of
   the dataless clients before you upgrade the server and halt them before
   you upgrade the server.

9) Bring the machine to be upgraded to single-user mode.

   # /etc/shutdown now

10) Run sunupgrade.

    # cd /usr/etc/install/tar/sunupgrade/shell

    # sunupgrade -v [-xVOLATILE_LIST]

    if you wish to see the list of the upgraded files, or

    # sunupgrade [-xVOLATILE_LIST]

    if you do not wish to see the list of the upgraded files.

11) Customize the kernel(s) if necessary.

12) Reboot each system modified: server first, then clients. 

See the chapter on Upgrading to Solaris 1.1 SMCC Version A in the manual
"Installing Solaris 1.1 SMCC Version A", which was included in the 
release documentation box, for more complete instructions on how to use 
sunupgrade.
