# This directory contains all the stuff for making the
# utility program 'mktp', and its subprograms.
# To make mktp, do 'make'.
# To install mktp, do 'make install'. The default installation
# place is in '..', but may be overridden by
# 	make install DESTDIR=directory
# where you pick the directory name.
#
# Below is a rough description of the prototype file.
#
# Other prototype sample input files also exist in this directory,
# and are installed in DESTDIR by the make install step.
#
###################################################################
#
# This is an example of a distribution description prototype file.
# This file is used to initially describe software distributions,
# along with information that will be passed along to the installation
# program (typically /usr/etc/install/suninstall), and also to
# give enough information to mktp program to actually make the distribution.
#
# This file has a general form of
#
#	Distribution Information
#	*==================
#	Entry Information
#	*==================
#	Entry Information
#		.
#		.
#		.
#	      (etc.)
#
# Distribution Information consists of Title, Version, Date and Source
# strings.
#
# Entry information describes a 'packaged' entry that will go into
# the distribution. This entry information is split into two parts:
# information intended to be passed ultimately to an installation
# program (e.g., suninstall) that will unpack the distribution, and
# the information to be used by mktp and its associated subprograms
# in order to aid you in packaging up the entries and placing them
# on the distribution media.
#
# First, a few nuts and bolts about the syntax of the prototype description
# language.
#
# These are Comment Lines. All lines beginning with '#' will be ignored
# by the parser.
#
# Lines begining with '*' are taken to be the beginning
# of command tokens. Command tokens are followed by '='
# chars, and then by zero or more user supplied strings,
# numbers, etc. The user supplied strings may not spill over
# to the next line.
#
# The following conventions will be observed in this example
# (That is, the following upper case names are definitions whose
# use in the rules below are declared here):
# 
#	STRING means any appropriate string. Leading and trailing white space
#		to a string will be discarded. A STRING may NOT continue
#		onto the next line.
#
#	STRING-LIST is a STRING which will then
#		be parsed into a list of strings. The separator
#		tokens are tabs and spaces. These will not be
#		included within strings.
#
#	SIZE means a number which may qualified by the trailing
#		chars of 'mb' or  'kb' meaning to mean, resp., megabytes
#		or kilobytes. No qualifier will have SIZE mean bytes.
#
#	{A|B|C|...} means that ONE of A,B, C, etc,
#		must be specified
#
#
# Below is a generalized version of what the prototype file should look
# like.
#
################################
# 
#	Now, the ordering in the prototype file is important.
#	First you must have the overall distribution information.
#
# Distribution Information
*Title=		STRING
*Version=	STRING
*Date=		STRING
*Source=	STRING
# Of the above STRINGs, only the Title is required to be supplied, but
# all the Command tokens must be there..., e.g.,
*Title=		SunOS Patch Tape for Joe
*Version=
*Date=
*Source=
#
# Would be a valid set of Distribution Information.
#
##
# Now starts the Entry Information.
#
# Note: all entries start with the '*=...'. Again, please note that
# the order in which stuff is laid out is important. Items which
# are optional must *still* have the command tokens in place
# (e.g., if no Description is given, you must have *Description=
# following *Name= anyway).
#
*=====
# First, is the information that is intended to pass through to the
# installation program. mktp itself cares not a whit as to the truth
# or meaning of this information, although it does enforce the rules
# to have some of it there.
#
# The first piece of information is the *name* of the entry.
# 
*Name=		STRING
#
# It also may have a LONG name, or a description.
*Description=	STRING
#
# Each entry has a Type, which will imply what the encoding format
# of the information within the entry is. Tar implies a tar file,
# cpio implies a cpio file, and image says 'other' (i.e., byte for
# byte image file- the extraction program will know).
# Again, note that one of tar, cpio or image must be selected.
#
*File-Type=	{tar|cpio|image}
#
# Each entry is of a Kind. That is, the Kind implies the intended *use*
# of the information in the entry. Amorphous means 'unknown', standalone
# means a standalone executable of some kind, executable means an
# executable, installable means software to install, and install-tool means
# an installable set of tools that are intended to be used to install
# an installable entry.
#
*File-Kind=	{ amorphous|standalone|executable|installable|install-tool }
#
# File-Type and File-Kind must be supplied
#########
# Based on File-Kind, different information is required.
#
# If amorphous, the following will be required:
#
Size=		SIZE
#
#	Size means the Size you say this amorphous file is. Remember, this
# information is being passed to the installation program.
#
######
#
# If standalone or executable, the following will be required:
#
*Architectures= STRING-LIST
*Size=		SIZE
#
#	Architectures may have a null list. They are intended to imply to
# the installation tool what machines this entry is intended to run on.
####
#
# If installable, the following will be required:
#
*Architectures= STRING-LIST
*Depends-on=	STRING-LIST
*Required=	{true|false}
*Desirable=	{true|false}
*Common=	{true|false}
*Loadpoint=	STRING
*Moveable=	{true|false}
*Size=		SIZE
*Pre-install=	STRING
*Install=	STRING
#
#	Only size and the boolean values required.
#
# Depends-on can be used to refer to other installable entries in the same
# distribution. This is so the installation tool can know what else to
# extract if in the installation process this entry is selected to be
# installed.
#
# Required/Desirable/Common are boolean values that indicate to the installation
# tool whether this entry is indeed Required... etc..
#
# Loadpoint is the pathname where the unpacked software will load on.
# Moveable sez whether or not 'Loadpoint' may be overridden.
#
# Size is the Size YOU are telling the installation tool what is.
#
# Pre-install may refer to an install-tool that is to be run prior to installing
# this package.
#
# Install may refer to an install-tool that will aid in installing this
# package.
#
####
#
# If install-tool, the following will be required:
#
*Belongs-to=	STRING-LIST
*Loadpoint=	STRING
*Moveable=	{true|false}
*Size=		SIZE
*Worksize=	SIZE
#
# Only  Size, Worksize and Moveable need values supplied
#
#	Size means SIZE of install tool.
#	Worksize means workspace that the install tool will need.
#
####
# The rest of the information here is used by mktp to actually
# help make the distribution.
#
# How to create the entry itself. The commands
# specified here will be fed to the Bourne Shell,
# and their purpose is to take the desired source
# data, format it into the desired format, and to
# send the data to the standard output
# 	*in the same form as if you were placing it on the distribution
#		device yourself, by hand*!!
#
#
*Command=	STRING
#	The command string may be null, but that would be pretty stupid.
#
#	Generally, for a tar file going to 1/4" cartridge tape, the
# 	command might be:
#
*Command=	cd dist_bin_dir; tar cfb - 200 filea fileb
#
# Next, for each entry, you have to state the *type* of the distribution
# device:
#
*Device-Type=	{tape|disk}
#
#	N.B. 9/17/87 - disk not supported.
#
# Then, you specify the SIZE of each volume of the device.
# Sorry, volumes must be of equal size.
#
*Device-Size=	SIZE
#
#	For example, a 12inch 1600 bpi 1/2" tape would be
#
*Device-Size=	35mb
#
# or, 35 megabytes.
#
# Finally, you specify the *root* name of the device you will use.
#
# That is, if you are putting stuff onto 1/2" tape at 1600 bpi,
# you would specify:
#
*Device-Rname=	mt0
#
# or 1/4" cartridge tape at low (QIC-11) density:
#
*Device-Rname=	st0
#
#	mktp will supply the rest of the name, assuming
#
#	a) The devices are all in /dev
#
#	b) The raw interface is accessed by prefixing a 'r' to the root name.
#
#	c) The tape devices have the no-rewind option set by prefixing
#		'nr' to the root name.
