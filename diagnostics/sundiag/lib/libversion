# libversion
# This file is used to control the release of libtest.a library. Only the
# authorized persion can touch this library log.  To get the log file updated,
# please type 'Make library' in current directory.  It will first
# make all the online related libraries and then log the following message:
#       New Version Log on 'date mark'
#       Modified from last libversion:
#                               'libversion version'
#       Reasons for this new version:
#       'Please give reasons'
#
# GOLDEN RULES for dealing with online library:
#       1) If you have new routines which you think useful or helpful to
#          the development of unix online packages, please let the person
#          in charge know and send a copy of the routines to him/her for
#          integration.
#       2) You can check the library source out for read, but never check
#          them back to SCCS after any type of code modification.
#       3) You can go to online library directory and type 'make' or
#          'make install', but never type 'make library' unless you are
#          assigned and authorized to do so.
