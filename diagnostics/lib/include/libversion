# libversion
# This file is used to control the release of libonline library. Only the
# authorized persion can touch this library log.  To get the log file updated,
# please go to its parent directory and type 'Make library'.  It will first
# make all the online related libraries and then log the following message:
# 	New Version Log on 'date mark'
#	Modified from last libversion:
#				'libversion version'
#	Reasons for this new version:
#	'Please give reasons'
#	
# GOLDEN RULES for dealing with online library:
#	1) If you have new routines which you think useful or helpful to 
#	   the development of unix online packages, please let the person
#	   in charge know and send a copy of the routines to him/her for
#	   integration. 
#	2) You can check the library source out for read, but never check 
#	   them back to SCCS after any type of code modification.
#	3) You can go to online library directory and type 'make' or
#	   'make install', but never type 'make library' unless you are
#	   assigned and authorized to do so.
