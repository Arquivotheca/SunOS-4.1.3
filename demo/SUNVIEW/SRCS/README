	This directory contains source files for some demos.  A "make"
	has to be done in order to create executables for these programs.
	Remember to allow write privelege on the directory.

cframedemo [ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Displays a rotating view of the world.  This demo must be executed
	in the directory containing the frames (sequence of raster images
	of the globe).  If the frame.x files are in demo/SRCS/DATA then
	run the demo as follows:
		% cd demo/SRCS/DATA
		% ../cframedemo

maze
	This demo has no user interaction.  It simply creates a random
	maze and tries a depth first solution.  If used for a lockscreen
	remember to run in nice mode, since this demo eats cpu cycles.

show file1 [file2 ...]

	Displays images in a window or on a raw screen.  Image files must be
	in Sun's standard raster file format (see /usr/include/rasterfile.h).
	Sample files are contained in the sub-directory DATA (colorimage.xx).
