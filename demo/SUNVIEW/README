	This is the top level directory for the demos that run under
	SUNVIEW.  The sub-directory EXECS contains executables of some
	demos and the sub-directory SRCS contains source files for 
	demos.  Refer the READMEs in these directories for more detail.

	The EXECS directory contains executable for programs for which the
	source code is located elsewhere or for which the source code has
	not been released.
