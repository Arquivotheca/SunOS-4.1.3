	This is the top level directory for the demos that run under
	OPENLOOK with XGL graphics.  Under this directory are two 
	directories: EXECS and SRCS.  
	
	The sub-directory EXECS is intended to contain the executables of demos 
	for which the source code is not released.  Examples of this are programs 
	which work with a particular product and are released with that product.  
	For example, configuration and management software for a third party product.


	The SRCS directory contains programs for which the sources are available.
	At the present time, the abilty to make XGL programs is an unbundled
	Sun software product.  Therefore, the executable versions of the
	programs are included in the distribution.
