                        --- contents of /usr/demo ---

This demo reflects the contents of the 1.1 show demo tape.

... refer to the system administrator's manual for instructions on pulling
    the demos programs off the release tape(s).

... The manual pages bwdemo and colordemo do not accurately reflect the
    contents of the /usr/demo directory.  This document should be referred to
    instead.

... All of the demos will run on all surfaces unless specifically noted.
    This incudes: the sun-1 monochrome monitor, the sun-2 monochrome monitor,
    the color monitor, b/w windows, and color windows.

... If run from the environment where the display is desired simply enter
    the demo name.  In order to change the display surface give the demo
    name followed by the option "-d /dev/surface". For example, to run
    the suncube demo on the color monitor, started from the b/w monitor,
    issue the command:

            suncube -d /dev/cg0.   

... All programs that do not use the mouse or keyboard for input can also
    be run with a "-q" option which allows the program to terminate
    quicker.  This allows several different demos to be run within a
    shell script.

... Demos running on color surfaces started from b/w windows cannot use
    mouse input so it makes no sense to run mixcolor, draw, and shaded in
    this fashion.

... to run a demo you can either "cd /usr/demo"  or  change your path to also
    look in the /usr/demo directory for binaries.

... Do not try to run demo's that do not use keyboard input from a shelltool.o
    You will be unable to interrupt them and will have "rescue" the shelltool
    from another window.

chessgame [ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Plays out a game of chess.  A move is made every 3 seconds.  The
	final position will remain for 5 minutes before normal termination.

draw [ -d /dev/surface ]

	A simple drawing program using mouse input. Refer to the User's 
	Manual for a complete description on how to use this demo. One
	warning, error reporting will interfere with the drawing. It is
	well advised to run this program in a graphics window.

mixcolor [ -d /dev/surface ]

	A color generator using the left button of the mouse as a pick device.

		1) pick the color you wish to change.
		2) pick the desired dial location.
		3) repeat 1 and 2 until satisfied.
		4) pick the target box(es).

	To quit pick the QUIT box.

product	[ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Produces a slide showing a typical sun-2/120 configuration.  Will
	display the slide for 33 minutes before terminating normally.

rotcube [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Rotates a cube with increasing velocity.  Will run continuously until
	interrupted.

shaded object [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Shades objects.  Objects are located in the sub-directory DATA.
	Choose from an icosahedron, glass, soccer ball, space shuttle,
	egg, or pyramid.  This demo can take up to 30-40 seconds to
	start up with certain objects.  Mouse input is required. To run:

		1) Click the left button of the mouse on the left grid to
		   set the x-y orientation. Click the middle button on the
		   right grid to set the x-z orientation. Click the left 
		   button away from either grid to open the features menu.

		2) After selecting the desired features with the left 
		   button, click the left button away from all objects to
		   exit the features menu.

		3) Click the right button to begin drawing the object

		4) When the figure is finished click the right button again 
		   to return to the grids and menu.

show	colorimage_file(s)

	Displays the color image contained in colorimage_file.  The color
	images are currently named COLORPIX/colorimage.1 (thru 9).  This 
	demo does not take the -d /dev/cg0 option.  To see all images in
	succession enter " show COLORPIX/* ".  The shell script "Runcolor"
	has been provided to run all the images until interrupted.

showmap	[ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Displays 10 map projections continuously until interrupted.  Each map 
	will be displayed for about 5 seconds (The maps are in the
	sub-directory MAPS).

stringart [ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]
		
	Will continuously display a different "work of art" every 5 seconds.
	A total of 24336 different designs are possible.  On color surfaces
	the designs will loop through the colors: red, olive, green, turquoise,
	blue, and violet.

suncube	[ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Displays a cube with the SUN logo mapped to each face.  Will run 
	continuously until interrupted.  On color surfaces the colors of 
	the logo segments will change gradually. On monochrome surfaces the 
	logo segments will remain hollow.
