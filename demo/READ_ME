                        --- contents of /usr/demo ---
... THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE UP TO DATE, USE WITH A GRAIN OF
    SALT.  After all, these are only demos.

... Refer to the system administrator's manual for instructions on pulling
    the demos programs off the release tape(s).

... Do not try to run demo's that do not use keyboard input from a shelltool.o
    You will be unable to interrupt them and will have to "rescue" the 
    shelltool by "quitting" form the menu.

... All of the demos will run on all surfaces unless specifically noted.
    This incudes: all -1 monochrome and color frame buffers,
    as well as Graphics Processor surfaces, b/w windows, and color windows.

... If run from the environment where the display is desired simply enter
    the demo name.  In order to change the display surface give the demo
    name followed by the option "-d /dev/surface". For example, to run
    the suncube demo on the cgone monitor, started from the b/w monitor,
    issue the command:

            suncube -d /dev/cgone0.

    The -d option is not supported by all demos.

... Some programs that do not use the mouse or keyboard for input can also
    be run with a "-q" option which allows the program to quickly terminate.
    This allows several different demos to be run within a shell script.

... Demos running on color surfaces started from b/w windows cannot use
    mouse input so it makes no sense to run draw and shaded in this fashion.

... To run a demo you can either "cd /usr/demo"  or  change your path to also
    look in the /usr/demo directory for binaries.

... All demos can be interrupted by ctrl-C. (except for demos that mask off
    input running in shelltools).

cframedemo [ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Displays a rotating view of the world.  This demo must be executed
	in the directory containing the frames (sequence of raster images
	of the globe).  If the frame.x files are in demo/globeframes then
	run the demo as follows:
		cd demo/globeframes
		../cframedemo

draw [ -d /dev/surface ]

	A simple drawing program using mouse input. Refer to the User's 
	Manual for a complete description on how to use this demo. One
	warning, error reporting will interfere with the drawing. It is
	well advised to run this program in a graphics window.

maze
	This demo has no user interaction.  It simply creates a random
	maze and tries a depth first solution.  If used for a lockscreen
	remember to run in nice mode, since this demo eats cpu cycles.

rotobj object

	This demo only runs in a Graphics Processor window.  Object data files
	are located in the sub-directory DATA and have .vecs suffixes.

	This demo uses the as yet undocumented command level interface to
	the GP.  The user is advised not to make assumptions about the
	command level interface and to use it on his own, at least for
	the time being.

show file1 [file2 ...]

	Displays images in a window or on a raw screen.  Image files must be
	in Sun's standard raster file format (see /usr/include/rasterfile.h).
	Sample files are contained in the directory /usr/demo/COLORPIX.
	Running "show COLORPIX/*" from /usr/demo will continuously cycle
	through all the sample images.

showmap	[ -q ] [ -d /dev/surface ]

	Displays 10 map projections continuously until interrupted.  Each map 
	will be displayed for about 5 seconds (The maps are in the
	sub-directory MAPS).

cdplayer cd-device

	Allows you to play audio compact disc on your Sun CD-ROM drive.
	Must run under Sunview. Head-phone required.
