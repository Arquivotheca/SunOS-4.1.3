 * Not all hosts need be here, however:
 * mailx can dope out stuff about hosts on the fly by looking
 * at addresses.  The machines needed here are:
 *	1) The local machine
 *	2) Any machines on the path to a network gateway
 *	3) Any machines with nicknames that you want to have considered
 *	   the same.
 * The machine id letters can be anything you like and are not seen
 * externally.  Be sure not to use characters with the 0200 bit set --
 * these have special meanings.
