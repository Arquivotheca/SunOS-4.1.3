Talk consists of two parts:

    talk itself, which is the user interface. Talk initiates the
	 talk requests and negotiates with the suitable talk daemons.

    talkd, the talk daemon. Talkd announces an invitation to talk
	 to a user on its' local machine and acts like a rendezvous
	 point for inter-machine talks. The socket address's of
	 the invitING talk process is kept at the local talkd of
	 the invitEE. Talkd must run as root, and should be forked
	 off on boot along with the other daemons. There is
	 no provision for automatic restart of talkd. If for
	 some reason it dies, it must be restarted by hand. Since
	 talkd opens a special addresses socket (517 at the present 
	 time), the first talkd to run will lock out any other
	 talkd. The locked out talkd will sit and bitch every
	 15 seconds for about five minutes, so don't leave it running.


So, to install:

	run 'make install' from the top of the talk source directory.
	The install will fail if an older version of talkd is still
	running. If it does fail because of a 'text file busy' error,
	kill the old talkd and 'make install' again.

	execute '/usr/lib/talkd' to start the daemon immediately.

	Install a line in /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local to fork talkd off in
	background on reboot. 

	Try talk. If it immediately fails with 'Bad system call', then
	you should recompile ctl.c with the -DGETSOCK flag and remake
	talk. This makes talk use getsockname (actually syscall(150))
	instead socketaddr(). This will go away once 4.1c stabilizes.
