The C shell now incorporates filename expansion directly, controlled
by whether or not the shell variable "filec" is set.  Thus, there's
no longer any reason to build csh and tcsh separately.

This change and others pertaining to the 4.3 merge have induced some
changes in the source file structure.

Renamed:
	tenex.c --> sh.file.c

Obsolete:
	malloc.c
	sh.sig.c
	tgt.mk

To recreate an early verson of the shell, the renaming will have to be
undone.
