Updated Tue Aug 22 14:30:50 PDT 1989


What							Who

General- C-style					EVERYONE

	Run cstyle over anything (.h && .c) that you are about to
	check in. When 4.1 goes beta, Bill Shannon will include sun4c
	and scsi and sbusdev in the 'auto cstyle' checking.  Matt has
	done all the sun4c header files and a large number of the .c
	files for sun4c. Matt will do scsi and sbusdev/dmaga.*. The
	people responsible for the rest of sbusdev must do the right
	thing here.

General- Head file guards				EVERYONE
	ALL THE HEADER FILES MUST CONFORM TO THE
	NEW STANDARD (bug id 1012708). See latest
	sun4c/pte.h for standard layout. 

	Current Status:	sun4c okay. sbusdev partially done.
