# Configuration file for running the Behavioral Simulator, based upon
# Configuration file for running the Sparc Architecture Simulator.
#
# A complete configuration of a SAS kernel requires the creation
# of a sas_simdef.h file in the directory that the objects are
# created in. This file contains definitions for the real devices
# that the simulator will use e.g.:
#
#	#define SIMD_RDEV	"/dev/rxy0a"
#	#define SIMD_RSIZE	32830
#	#define SIMD_SDEV	"/dev/rxy0b"
#	#define SIMD_SSIZE	65660
