CONFIGURING THE KERNEL

1. Choose a name for your configuration of the system; here, PICKLE.
2. Create the config file by making a writable copy of GENERIC:
	cp GENERIC PICKLE; chmod +w PICKLE
3. Edit PICKLE to reflect your system, e.g., delete devices that will
   never be present on your system.
4. Run config:  
	/etc/config PICKLE
	(the directory ../PICKLE will be made if it doesn't exist and
	a "make depend" will be done unless you specify a "-n" flag)
5. Make the new system:
	cd ../PICKLE
	make
6. Typically the running kernel should be "/vmunix" because programs
   like 'ps' and 'w' expect "/vmunix" to be the running kernel.
   Save the original kernel, install the new one in /vmunix, and
   try it out:
	mv /vmunix /vmunix.old
	cp vmunix /vmunix
	/etc/halt
	b vmunix
7. If the system does not appear to work, boot and restore the
   original kernel, then fix the new kernel:
	/etc/halt
	b vmunix.old -s
	mv /vmunix.old /vmunix
	^D      [Brings the system up multi-user]

CONFIGURING AN OBJECT-ONLY DISTRIBUTION

The following lines from the GENERIC config file must be in every
config file for object-only configurations:

	machine		"sunN"		# where 'N' is 2 or 3 or 4
	options		INET

	pseudo-device	loop

Failing to include these lines in a config file will probably result
in undefined routines during the making of the kernel, but may just
silently cause the resulting kernel to blow up.

Except for drivers which supply the source for sizing data structures
(e.g., xy_conf.c, sc_conf.c, xd_conf.c), you may not configure in more
devices of a particular type than is allowed by the distributed object
code in ../OBJ.  Attempting to do so will not be detected and may cause
the kernel to appear to work but have only occasional failures.  Double
check the .h files in ../OBJ if you change the number of devices
configured for any standard drivers.

See the manual page for config(8) and the Sun System Manager's Guide
for further details.

ADDING A DEVICE DRIVER

New device drivers require entries in ../../sun/conf.c, files, and
possibly ../../sun/swapgeneric.c and devices. They are included by
mentioning the device name in the config file.  Examples:

  ../../sun/conf.c:


	#include "cgone.h"
	#if NCGONE > 0
	int	cgoneopen(), cgonemmap(), cgoneioctl();
	int	cgoneclose();
	#else
	#define	cgoneopen	nodev
	#define	cgonemmap	nodev
	#define	cgoneioctl	nodev
	#define	cgoneclose	nodev
	#endif

    {
	cgoneopen,	cgoneclose,	nodev,		nodev,		/*14*/
	cgoneioctl,	nodev,		nodev,		0,
	seltrue,	cgonemmap,
    },

  files:
	sundev/cgone.c		optional cgone device-driver

  PICKLE:
	device			cgone0 at mbmem ? csr 0xec000 priority 3
