/*
 * Filesystem-independent directory information.
 * Directory entry structures are of variable length.
 * Each directory entry is a struct dirent containing its file number, the
 * offset of the next entry (a cookie interpretable only the filesystem
 * type that generated it), the length of the entry, and the length of the
 * name contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name. The
 * entire entry is padded with null bytes to a 4 byte boundary. All names
 * are guaranteed null terminated. The maximum length of a name in a
 * directory is MAXNAMLEN, plus a null byte.
