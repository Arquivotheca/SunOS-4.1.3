/*
 * Header file for Sun Microsystems keyboard routines
 *
 * The keyboard is a standard Micro Switch, or otherwise, keyboard,
 * with an 8048/8748 on the board.  This has been modified to produce
 * up/down keycodes.
 *
 * On Sun-1 keyboards these keycodes are output on 8 parallel output lines.
 * Each keycode is held stable on these lines for a minimum of 2.5 ms in
 * order that the main processor can read it during its refresh
 * routine, which executes every 2 ms or so.  
 *
 * On Sun-2 keyboards, the keycodes are transmitted on a serial line
 * at 1200 baud.
 *
 * When no physical keys are depressed, the keyboard transmits a keycode of
 * "IDLE" (7F hex), to indicate that.  Thus, when the last key is released,
 * a keycode for its release is sent, then an IDLE.  Note that virtual
 * keys on the VT100 kbd (eg CAPS LOCK) can be down when the IDLE code
 * is received.
 *
 * The Sun-1 VT100 keyboard will follow each of its IDLE's with a
 * keyboard id code, identifying the key layout or other factors
 * which host programs might want to automatically determine.
 * The support for this feature is marked with "#ifdef KBDID".
 * The only good it currently does us is to tell us the state of
 * the "caps lock" LED/virtual key when we have been reset.
 *
 * The low 4 bits of the id byte contain the keyboard ID (currently
 * 1 for VT100 keyboard); the high order bit is set (to make sure
 * there's a transition between the IDLE (7F) and the identification
 * byte); the -XXX---- bits contain state information about the keyboard.
 * These bits are allocated from opposite ends in case we need to shift
 * the boundary.  The only state bit currently defined is 0x40, which is
 * the current state of the CAPS LOCK LED.
 *
 * The Sun-2 keyboard also transmits two other "special" keycodes:
 *
 *	RESETKEY	upon power-up, when no errors are detected,
 *			this code is sent and followed by the keyboard id,
 *			a byte containing 0x02.
 *
 *	ERRORKEY	upon power-up, when errors are detected, 
 *			this code is sent and followed by a "cause" byte
 *			giving more details.  There is only one cause byte
 *			defined so far -- checksum error on PROM.
 *
 * Due to table size limits, the configuration file for the
 * ROM monitor must specify what keyboard it will support, by using:
 * 	options KEYBKL or KEYBVT or KEYBS2
 *

 * is received.  This ensures that where we "think" the shift & bucky
 * keys are, more accurately reflects where they really are, since the

				   information back to the caller with each
				   "real" key depressed.  The concept, and
				   name "bucky" (derivation unknown) comes
				   from the MIT/SAIL "TV" system...they had
				   TOP, META, CTRL, and a few other bucky
				   bits.  The bit position of its bit in
				   "buckybits", minus 7, is added to the
				   entry; eg bit 0x00000400 is BUCKYBITS+3.
				   The "-7" prevents us from messing up the
				   ASCII char, and gives us 16 useful bucky
				   bits.  When this entry is invoked,
