General:
--------

	A new library, libpfc.a, has been created for linking programs
	written in mixed pascal, fortran, and C.  This library contains
	routines to invoke startup and cleanup for both fortran and
	pascal runtime facilities.

	The library may be used as an option by either the f77 or pc
	command.  F77 and pc should optionally include the libraries of
	the other language when linking a program containing both f77
	and pascal object files.

	Source changes are done in the f77 and pc library directories,
	and are bracketed by #ifdef LIBPFC so that the normal pascal
	and f77 libraries are unaffected.

	libpfc.a itself is built in its own directory, and all sources
	are accessed by symbolic links.  It is assumed that all of the
	relevant directories exist at the same level in /usr/src/usr.lib/.


Pascal library source changes:
------------------------------

	(PCSTART.c, PCEXIT.c): The routines PCSTART() and PCEXIT() have
	been changed to conditionally call their Fortran counterparts
	(f_init() and f_exit()), and set Fortran's copies of argc and
	argv (called xargc and xargv, respectively).

F77 library source changes:
---------------------------

	(main.c): The function main() is modified to conditionally
	call PCSTART and PCEXIT instead of f_init() and f_exit().
	Note that this change is only required by fortran main programs,
	since the pascal compiler generates main() in-line.

	(s_stop.c): s_stop() is modified like main(), to conditionally
	call PCEXIT() instead of f_exit().
