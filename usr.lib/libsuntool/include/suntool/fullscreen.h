/*
 * Sometimes one has to violate window boundaries in order to provide
 * certain kinds of feedback to the user.  Popup menus and window management
 * are examples of the kinds of operations that need to do this.
 * This interface provides a mechanism for doing this.
 *
 * The coordinate space of full screen access is the same as the window
 * that created the full screen object.  Thus, pixwin accesses are not
 * necessarily done in the screen's coordinate space.
 * Also, the screen rect associated with the full screen object are in
 * the window's coordinate space.
 *
 * The original cursor and input mask are cached and later restored when the
 * the full screen access object is destroyed.
 * 
 * By definition there should only be one instance of window boundary violating
 * per process at any one time
 * (sunwindow will keep different processes straight) thus the existence of
 * fsglobal global variable below.  However, clean programmers will use the
 * handle passed back from fullscreen_init instead of fsglobal.
