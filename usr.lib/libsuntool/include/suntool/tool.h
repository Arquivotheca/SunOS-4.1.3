/*
 * A tool is a stylized window that is used as the conceptual entity
 * that glues subwindows together into a functional package.
 * It is usually a child of the root window, has a name stripe at its top,
 * is responsible for providing borders around its subwindows
 * and displays as an icon when a bit is set in the tool windows user flags.
 *
 * A tool will arrange its subwindows in a tiled configuration whenever
 * its own size changes.  It can also provide a subwindow boundary adjustment
 * interface.
 *
 * The default tool window manager positions iconic tools on byte and n%4 line
 * boundaries so that if you include desktop gray in your icon image
 * the patterns will match.  A default icon is used if none is specified.
 *
 * A typical programs sequence:
 * 1) tool_new returns tool struct with the given attributes.
 *  The attribute list is a series of attribute number/value pairs terminated
 *  by a zero.
 * 2) foo_createtoolsubwindow is called to create each "foo" type of subwindow.
 *  The subwindows are created in a left to right and top to bottom sequence
 *  which gives the tool's layout mechanism a chance to do reasonable default
 *  positioning given the passed in width and height.
 * 3) tool_select is called to do select system calls for all the windows.
 *  The ts_io.tio_selected routine is called when a subwindow is "selected".
 * 6) tool_sigwinch is called when a SIGWINCH is received.
 *  tool_select calls * tl_io.tio_handlesigwinch later.
 *  The default implementation of tl_io.tio_handlesigwinch will resize
 *  the subwindows on a tool size change,
 *  calls each ts_io.tio_handlesigwinch and fixes its own damage.
 * 7) tool_destroy called before exiting process.
