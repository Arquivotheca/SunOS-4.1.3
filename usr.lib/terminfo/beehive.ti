#
# beehive: BEEHIVE
#
# Manufacturer:	BEEHIVE
# Class:	II
# 
# Info:
#	Beehive documentation is undated 
#	(Preliminary) and has no figures so we must have early Superbee2
#	(Model 600, according to phone conversation with mfr.). It has 
#	proved reliable except for some missing padding requirements 
#	(notably after \EK and nl at bottom of screen).
#	
#	The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for cm & that US's in 
#	the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means 
#	that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80 
#	characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also 
#	appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses
#	US. The sbi fakes al with an 80-space insert that may be too 
#	slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \040 which is 
#	too long for some programs (not vi). DEL LINE is ok but slow.
#	
#	The nl string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cm to 
#	25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.
#	
#	There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to
#	pop to a new (blank) page after a nl, or leave a half-line 
#	elipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The 
#	data received is dumped into memory but not displayed. Not to 
#	worry if cm is being used; the lines not displayed will be, 
#	whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since cm is addressed 
#	relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of 
#	relative cursor motion (up,do,nd,bs). Recommended, therefore, 
#	is setenv MORE -c .
#	
#	WARNING: Not all features tested.
#	
#	Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect 
#	SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.
#	Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.
#	
#	The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly 
#	placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made 
#	into a backspace key. In use ESC must be pressed twice (to send)
#	and sending ^C must be prefixed by ESC to avoid that wierd 
#	transmit mode associated with ENTER key.
#	
#	IF TERMINAL EVER GOES CATATONIC with the cursor buzzing across 
#	the screen, then it has dropped into ENTER mode; hit 
#	RESET--ONLINE--!tset.
#	
#	As delivered this machine has a FATAL feature that will throw 
#	it into that strange transmit state (SPOW) if the space bar is 
#	hit after a CR is received, but before receiving a LF (or a 
#	few others).
#	
#	The circuits MUST be modified to eliminate the SPOW latch. 
#	This is done by strapping on chip A46 of the I/O board; cut 
#	the p.c. connection to Pin 5 and Strap Pin 5 to Pin 8 of that 
#	chip. This mod has been checked out on a Mod 600 of Superbee II.
#	With this modification absurdly high timings on cr are 
#	unnecessary.
#	
#	NOTE WELL that the rear panel switch should be set to CR/LF, 
#	not AEP!
