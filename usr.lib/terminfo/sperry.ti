# # --------------------------------
#
# sperry: SPERRY
#
# Manufacturer:	SPERRY
# Class:	III
# Info:
#	This is a terminal that is (going to be) used with increasing 
#	frequency here, internally at sperry. It is also similar, i 
#	believe, to the terminal that comes with the sperry pcs that 
#	have recenty made an entry into the micro market.
#	It doesn't have everything that the uts30 has to offer, i'm 
#	sure (read hope), but its a start.
#	
#	
#	This entry is for the Sperry UTS30 terminal running the TTY 
#	utility under control of CP/M Plus 1R1. The functionality 
#	provided is comparable to the DEC vt100.
