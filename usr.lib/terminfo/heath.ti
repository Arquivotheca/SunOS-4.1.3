# Info:
#	This still doesn't work right - something funny is going on 
#	with return # and linefeed in the reach program. Apparently 
#	cr acts like crlf and lf is ignored. There is a "literal end 
#	of line mode" which works right, but this will cause cr's to 
#	appear in files that are spooled. This description assumes 
#	"normal end of line mode".

# Info:
#	The major problem with the Z29 is that it requires more 
#	padding than the Z19. Once again, here's a little termcap 
#	entry for it that will do the trick. 
#	
#	The problem declaring an H19 to be synonomous with a Z29 is that
#	it needs more padding. It especially loses if a program attempts
#	to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It
#	even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600
#	baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in 
#	order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that
#	whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective 
#	rate is about 110 baud.
#	
#	What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode 
#	and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?  
#	
#	Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal 
#	thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.
#	When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is 
#	already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of 
#	the line and outputing the new line, it compares the old line 
#	and the new line and if there are any similarities, it 
#	constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line 
#	on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new
#	text into the line to transform it into the new line that is 
#	to be displayed. The Z29 does not act kindly to this.
#	
#	But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make
#	a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.
#	Then Emacs cannot use it. "Oh, no, but now inserting into a 
#	line will be really slow", you say. Well there is a sort of a
#	solution to that too. There is an insert character option on 
#	the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it 
#	involves putting the terminal into ansi mode, inserting the 
#	character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12 
#	characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it 
#	works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when 
#	it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't 
#	require padding with this (the former is probably more likely, 
#	but I haven't checked it out).
