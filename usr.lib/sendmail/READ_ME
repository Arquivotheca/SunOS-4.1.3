The first thing you should look at is the documentation.  The two
critical documents are "Sendmail - An Internetwork Router" and
"Sendmail - Installation and Operation Guide". Read both of these
before proceeding with your installation.  If you have read these
before, you should still read through the second one again anyhow,
since the installation procedures change occasionally.

A brief tour:
	Makefile  A Makefile that will install Sendmail in the Sun Unix
		  system.
	READ_ME	  This file.
	aux	  Useful programs and shell scripts for debugging and
		  administering sendmail and the network mail environment.
		  Also, some C source files for peculiar configurations.
	cf	  The sources and "object" for the configuration files.
	include	  The include files used by more than just the sendmail
		  program itself.
	lib	  Master copies of files used by sendmail, e.g. the aliases
		  file.
	md	  Some m4 files used to isolate machine dependencies.
	src	  The source for the sendmail program itself.

Sendmail is fully supported by Sun Microsystems, like any other part of
the Sun Unix system.  Contact Sun technical support if you have problems.

Sendmail was originally written by Eric Allman of Britton-Lee, Inc.
