"value after ... flag"

flag with a value.  This is not
allowed.
-13
"value after ... flag"
You used the -f option to add the flag

a value for the flag.  However, the
named flag cannot be assigned a value.
-14
"no default sid"
You are trying to add the 'd' flag
(default SID) to the SCCS file, but you
did not supply an SID argument.  This
flag must have an SID.
-15
"more than one file"
You can only create one SCCS file when
using -i.
-16
"r only allowed with i"
The -r option cannot not be specified
without the -i.
-17
"t has no argument"
You were creating a new SCCS file, and
used the -t option, but you did not
supply the name of the text file from
which to take the commentary.
-18
"d not allowed with n"
You are trying to delete flags from an
SCCS file being created for the first
time.  You can only delete flags from
files that already exist.
-19
"file ... exists"
You are trying to create the named SCCS
file, but it already exists.
-20
"file ... does not exist"
You are trying to modify the named
file, but it does not exist.
-21
"... illegal data on line ..."
The named line in the file you supplied
with the -i or -t options begins with
the SCCS control character (ASCII
001).
-22
"floor not numeric"
The value you specified for the floor
flag is not a number.  Check for
typos.
-23
"floor out out of range"
The value you specified for the floor
flag is either less than 1 or greater
than 9999.
-24
"ceiling not numeric"
The value you specified for the ceiling
flag is not a number.  Check for
typos.

The name specified for the SCCS file
name was a directory.  Only one SCCS
file is allowed to be specified with -i.
-27
"bad list format"
The format for the list of locked
releases is syntactically incorrect.
The correct format for a list is:

    <list>  ::= <range> | <list>,<range>
	<range> ::= REL_NO | ``a''

where REL_NO is considered to be the
first component in the SID.
-28
"element in list out of range"
An element contained in the list for
``locking'' or ``unlocking'' releases
is out of range.  That means its value
is probably greater than 9999, the
maximum release number.
-29
"directory `...' specified as `...'
keyletter value"
The value specified with the named
option is a directory.  This is not
allowed since the SCCS file created
would not be accessible by other SCCS
commands.
-30
"illegal use of `y' or `m' keyletter"
The -y and -m options may only be used
in conjunction with -i or -n, when creating
a new.  SCCS file.  Use "cdc" to change the
comments or MR numbers of an existing
file.
-31
"not a text file"
The file you are checking in to SCCS is
not a text file.  This is a warning
because the SCCS file could grow very
large with many deltas.
-32
"`...' line `...' too long"
Lines longer than 512 characters (not
counting the newline at the end) cannot
be handled by SCCS.  Shorten the line,
possibly by breaking it into two or
more lines, and try the "admin" again.
-33
"'b' keyletter can only be used with 'i' keyletter"
The -b option, which indicates that a
file should be treated as binary and
checked in in an encoded form, may only
be specified if an SCCS file is being
initialized.
