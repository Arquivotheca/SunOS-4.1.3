-1
"arg count"
You invoked bdiff with either too few
or too many arguments.
-2
"both files standard input"
You supplied a name of '-' for both
file-name arguments to bdiff.  Since
'-' means to read the standard input,
you are requesting that bdiff read it
for both its inputs.  That would lead
to highly grungeular randomness.
-3
"cannot fork, try again"
Bdiff could not fork to invoke 'diff'.
This is a system problem which may go
away, so try again.  If it doesn't,
report it to the system support group.
-4
"non-numeric limit"
The argument supplied to bdiff to
specify the segmentation limit bdiff is
to use is not numeric.  Only numeric
characters may appear in this
argument.
-5
"cannot execute ..."
The named program could not be executed
by bdiff.  It may be unexecutable, or
it may have been removed.  Contact SCCS
support personnel for further
assistance.
-6
"... failed"
The named program terminated with an
error.  It may have discovered an error
condition or may have been
interrupted.  Contact SCCS support
personnel for further assistance.
