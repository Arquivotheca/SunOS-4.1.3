-1
"not an SCCS file"
A file that you think is an SCCS file
does not begin with the `s.' prefix.
-3
"more than one link"
SCCS files may only have one name
(link).  This is because the delta
command unlinks the old file and then
links to the new file.
-4
"format error at line ..."
The format of the SCCS file is
invalid.  The error was discovered at
the stated line.  The prs command may
help to reveal the problem.
-5
"premature eof"
The SCCS file was truncated somehow.
It may be best to restore it from a
backup tape.
-6
"corrupted file"
The computed hash count of the input
SCCS file did not check with the stored
hash count.  The file may have been
damaged since it was last accessed.  It
may be possible to repair the damage.
Refer to sccs-admin(1) for details.
-7
"too long"
The pathname is too long.
-8
"invalid sid"
The specified SID is syntactically
incorrect.
-10
"clock set wrong!!!"
This error occurs when the creation
date of the newest delta in the SCCS
file is newer than the current date.
This will happen whenever the date is
accidently set wrong.  This error will
also occur if a delta was created while
the clock was set ahead - but less than
a year - and has since been corrected.
In this case the current time is
correct, but the date of the delta is
wrong.)
-11
"Clock may be set wrong!"
The time of day may be set wrong.
Check the current time with the "date"
command.  (This message is produced
whenever the difference between the
current date and the creation date of
the newest delta in the SCCS file is
greater than one year.)
-12
"bad range"
In a delta list, the two limits of a
range of deltas were not in ascending
order.
-13
"delta list syntax"
A list of deltas was syntatically erroneous.  The correct syntax is:

		<list>	::=  <range> | <list> , <range>
		<range>	::=  <delta> | <delta> - <delta>
		<delta>	::=  <rel> | <rel> . <lev>
-14
"not authorized to make deltas"
Your login name or group ID is not on
the list of users who are allowed to
add deltas to this file.  You can
execute "prs -d:UN: file" to see who is
allowed.
-15
"release ... < ... (floor)"
Either the release you specified or
else the default release is lower than
the lowest allowable release (the
floor).  Refer to sccs-admin(1) for
details.
-16
"release ... > ... (ceiling)"
Either the release you specified or
else the default release is higher than
the highest allowable release (the
ceiling). Refer to sccs-admin(1) for
details.
-17
"bad p-file format"
The permissions file (p.file) is
damaged.  If you have write permission
on the directory containing the file,
you may be able to remove it.  However,
if you do, you must also notify all
affected users that they must check out
their files once again, and restore
their pending changes.
-18
"line too long"
SCCS cannot process files containing
lines of more than 512 characters.
-19
"response too long"
A response can't be so long.  Try
typing less (maybe you can refer to
some other document).
-20
"cannot fork; try again"
The system is busy; you'll have to try
again later.
-21
"too many MRs"
You can't enter that many MRs.
-22
"out of space"
Your MRs took up too much memory.
-23
... locked against editing
The specified release (or possibly all
releases) for the SCCS file have been
locked using the l flag.  Do a

	prs -d:LK: s.filename

to see a list of locked releases ('a'
means "all").
