*      Messages for SCCS rmdel-cdc commands.
*
-1
"missing r"
You did not supply an SID the -r option
when invoking rmdel or cdc.  This
option is always required.
-2
"file ... does not exist"
You named a file to be processed and it
does not exist.
-3
"nonexistent sid"
You specified an SID that is not
present in the SCCS file.
-4
"you are neither owner nor ..."
You either don't own the file you are
trying to process or your login-name is
not the same as the one that created
the delta.  Only the creator of a delta
can rmdel or cdc it.
-5
"not a 'leaf' delta"
You are attempting to remove a delta
which is not the newest (most recent)
delta in its branch of the delta tree.
Only the latest may be removed.
-6
"MRs not allowed"
The `v' flag is not set for the file,
and so, MRs cannot be supplied for it.
-7
"invalid MRs"
One or more of the MR numbers you
entered in response to a prompt by cdc
is invalid.
-8
"MRs required"
No MRs were specified, but the file
being processed requires them.
-9
"delta specified has delivered MR"
The delta your are processing with
contains an MR number entry that has
been marked "delivered."  You cannot
rmdel or cdc such a delta.
-10
"bad invocation"
You invoked 'rmdel' or 'cdc' by some
name other than (n)rmdel or (n)cdc (you
have a link to it).  The program's
execution depends on being invoked by
one of these names only.
-11
"r has no sid"
You specified -' option without an
SID.  Both are required.
-12
"being edited -- sid is in p-file"
Someone is in the process of making a
delta based upon the same delta (sid)
you specified with -r.  This is
indicated by the presence of the
specified sid in an entry of the p-file
for the named SCCS file.  Removal of
the delta specified is prohibited
because its removal would interfere
with other work in progress.
-13
"may not remove the last delta"
This is the last remaining delta.  You
may not remove it.
