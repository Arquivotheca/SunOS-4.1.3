*	Messages common to more than one SCCS command.

-1
"unknown key letter"
You supplied a keyletter or option that
the command does not recognize.
-2
"key letter twice"
You supplied an option more than once.
-3
"missing file arg"
You omitted the name of the file(s) to
be processed.
-4
"cannot create lock file"
There are two known reasons why this
may occur:

    Someone else is updating the SCCS
    file (or the p-file).  You'll have
	to wait until they're through, and
	try again.

    You do not have write permission in
    the directory where the SCCS file
    resides.
-5
"bad date/time"
The date/time must be a legitimate
date/time in the form:

    YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

The program knows about things like
leap years, so be precise.
