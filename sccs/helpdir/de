*       Messages for delta command of SCCS.
*
-1
"missing -r argument"
You must specify an SID when you are
listed more than once in the p-file.
-2
"login name or SID specified not in p-file"
Either your login name, or the SID you
specified, is not listed in the
p-file.  You probably forgot to do a
get -e, or supplied the wrong SID.
-3
"invalid sid in p-file"
The permissions file (p.file) is
damaged.  If you have write permission
on the directory containing the file,
you may be able to remove it.  However,
if you do, you must also notify all
affected users that they must check out
their files once again, and restore
their pending changes.
-4
"diff failed"
The diff command, which delta uses to
determine what lines changed, did not
succeed, and so no changes were checked in.
-5
"internal error in delta/enter()"
Report this error to your technical support
personnel immediately.
-6
"internal error in delta/enter()"
Report this error to your technical support
personnel immediately.
-7
"internal error in delta/enter()"
Report this error to your technical support
personnel immediately.
-8
"MRs not allowed"
You specified MRs, but the file being
processed doesn't allow them.
-9
"invalid MRs"
The MR validation program returned a
non-zero status.  This indicates that
one or more of the MRs specified are
invalid.
-10
"MRs required"
No MRs were specified, but the file
being processed requires them.
-11
"cannot fork, try again"
Delta could not invoke the diff command
for identifying changes to the file.
This may be the result of a system
problem that may go away, so try
again.  Repeated attempts continue to
fail, contact your system
administrator.
-12
"cannot execute ..."
... the named program.  The program may be
unexecutable, or it may have been removed.
Contact your system administrator.
-13
"... failed, re-trying, segmentation = ..."
The named program failed.  The most
likely cause is that files to be compared
by the program are being segmented
into chunks that are too large.
Therefore, delta re-tries with smaller
chunks.  (However, the smallest chunk
it will try is 500 lines.  If this
fails, it gives up hope and terminates
processing of the SCCS file.)  Do a
"help de17" for more information.
-14
"leading SOH char in line ... of file ... not allowed"
The ASCII character SOH (binary 001) is
in the first position of a line.  This
character is not allowed in the first
position for any line of text in an
SCCS file.  However, it may be used if
it is escaped.
-15
"ambiguous `r' keyletter value"
Which delta (SID) do you want to make?
Look at the p-file, pick one, and
specify it with the -r option.
-16
When delta reads arguments from the
standard input it will not prompt for
comments or MRs, so these values must
be supplied with the file argument.
-17
Because of the segmentation problem
caused by limited system work space,
the SCCS file that delta created may
occupy an inordinate amount of file
space.  To reduce the size of the SCCS
file, the user may want to remove the
delta just created and retry when the
system is more lightly loaded (and
hopefully more work space is available).
If no subsequent delta has been made,
the procedure for doing this would be:

1)  get -k s.file
2)  rmdel -rSID s.file
3)  get -e -g s.file
4)  delta s.file

where, of course, SID and file are
specified appropriately.  Also steps 1
and 3 may require that you specify a
SID, depending on your situation.
-18
"line too long"
Lines longer than 508 characters (not
counting the newline at the end) cannot
be handled by SCCS.  Shorten the line,
possibly by breaking it into two or
more lines, and try the "delta" again.
