*	Messages for get command of SCCS.
*
-3
"e not allowed with m"
You can't use both the -e and -m
arguments on the same get command.
-4
"writable `...' exists"
For safety's sake, SCCS won't overwrite
an existing g-file if it's writable.
If you don't need the g-file, remove it
and rerun the get command.
-5
"nonexistent sid"
The specified sid does not exist in the
given file.  Check for typos.
-9
"... already included"
You mentioned the same delta twice with
a -i and/or a -x argument.
-10
"... already excluded"
You mentioned the same delta twice with
a -x and/or a -i argument.
-11
"internal error in get/enter()"
Report this error to your technical support
personnel immediately.
-17
"being edited: `...'"
You can't check out the file because it
is already checked out.  If it is
checked ou to you, and you need to
retreive it again, you can do so using
"get -k." The data in quotes is from
the p-file.
-18
"being edited: `...'"
Someone else has done a get with an -e
argument.  This can't hurt what you're
doing, but isn't it nice to know that
someone else is making deltas to this
file too?
-19
"release locked against editing"
The release retrieved by `get' for
editing purposes (get -e) is locked
against further editing.  "prs -d:LK:"
on the SCCS file tells you which
releases are locked.  The `admin'
command is used to lock and unlock
releases.
-20
"curdir failed"
Re-check what you did.  Re-try the
command.  If the problem persists,
contact your technical support
personnel.
-21
"cannot change directory"
If you know the directory name, then
check to see if it exists.  Re-try the
command.  If the problem persists,
contact your technical support personnel.
-22
"r out of range"
The release number specified with the -r
option is out of range.  This means the
number was greater than 9999 or less than 1.
