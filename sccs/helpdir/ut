-1
"directory `...' nonexistent"
-2
"directory `...' unwritable"
The effective user (probably you)
doesn't have write permission in the
directory.  Do a "ls -ld ..." to check
the modes.
-3
"no file"
The system's table of open files is
temporarily full.  If this error
recurs, report it to your technical
support personnel.
-4
"`...' nonexistent"
The file does not exist.  Check for
typos.
-5
"`...' unreadable"
The file exists, but the effective user
doesn't have write permission.  It is
also possible that you don't have
search permission on one or more
directories in the file's path (a
directory's ``x'' bit isn't set).
-6
"`...' unwritable"
The file exists, but the effective user
doesn't have write permission.  It is
also possible that you don't have
search permission on one or more
directories in the file's path (a
directory's ``x'' bit isn't set).
-7
"`...' unreadable or unwritable"
The file exists, but the effective user
either doesn't have read permission, or
write permission, or both.  It is also
possible that you don't have search
permission on one or more directories
in the file's path (a directory's ``x''
bit isn't set).
-8
"write error"
The file which caused the write error
is as large as a file can be.
-9
"out of space"
The system has no more memory space
available.
-10
"no space!"
The file system (on which the file
which caused the error is being
written) is out of space.  This is very
serious!!  Contact your technical
support personnel for assistance.
Also, if you can remove any files,
please do so.
-11
"errno = ..., function = `...'"
An unusual and unexpected error
occured.  Try "help stuck".
-12
"SIGNAL: ..."
This error is most likely due to an
intermittent hardware error.  You
should report this to your local
technical support personnel
immediately, since others may be
getting the same error and it is useful
to discover a pattern if one exists.
After reporting the problem, you may
attempt to run the command again.
