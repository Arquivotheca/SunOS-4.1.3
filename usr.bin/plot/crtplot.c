This plotting routine interprets plot commands and outputs them onto
intelligent terminals (ie, terminals with clear screen and cursor
addressability.  It uses the curses library.  It should be compiled
as follows:
	cc crtdriver.c crtplot.c -lcurses -ltermcap -lm
Note:  This requires as slightly modified driver from the standard driver
because some function names conflicted with the curses library.
(That's what you get when you have a flat name space!)

	This method works by drawing the line from the beginning point

	arc that we wish to draw on one side of the line.  If we evaluate
	side(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c, then all of the points on one side of the
	line will result in side being positive, and all the points on the
	other side of the line will result in side being negative.

	We want to draw the arc in a counter-clockwise direction, so we
	must find out what the sign of "side" is for a point which is to the 
	"right" of a line drawn from "beg" to "end".  A point which must lie 
	on the right is [xbeg + (yend-ybeg), ybeg - (xend-xbeg)].  (This
	point is perpendicular to the line at "beg").

	Thus, we compute "side" of the above point, and then compare the
	sign of side for each new point with the sign of the above point.
	When they are different, we terminate the loop.
