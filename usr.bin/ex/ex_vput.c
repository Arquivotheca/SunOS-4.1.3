/*
 * This is the hardest code in the editor, and deals with insert modes
 * on different kinds of intelligent terminals.  The complexity is due
 * to the cross product of three factors:
 *
 *	1. Lines may display as more than one segment on the screen.
 *	2. There are 2 kinds of intelligent terminal insert modes.
 *	3. Tabs squash when you insert characters in front of them,
 *	   in a way in which current intelligent terminals don't handle.
 *
 * The two kinds of terminals are typified by the DM2500 or HP2645 for
 * one and the CONCEPT-100 or the FOX for the other.
 *
 * The first (HP2645) kind has an insert mode where the characters
 * fall off the end of the line and the screen is shifted rigidly
 * no matter how the display came about.
 *
 * The second (CONCEPT-100) kind comes from terminals which are designed
 * for forms editing and which distinguish between blanks and ``spaces''
 * on the screen, spaces being like blank, but never having had
 * and data typed into that screen position (since, e.g. a clear operation
 * like clear screen).  On these terminals, when you insert a character,
 * the characters from where you are to the end of the screen shift
 * over till a ``space'' is found, and the null character there gets
 * eaten up.
 *
 *
 * The code here considers the line as consisting of several parts
 * the first part is the ``doomed'' part, i.e. a part of the line
 * which is being typed over.  Next comes some text up to the first
 * following tab.  The tab is the next segment of the line, and finally
 * text after the tab.
 *
 * We have to consider each of these segments and the effect of the
 * insertion of a character on them.  On terminals like HP2645's we
 * must simulate a multi-line insert mode using the primitive one
 * line insert mode.  If we are inserting in front of a tab, we have
 * to either delete characters from the tab or insert white space
 * (when the tab reaches a new spot where it gets larger) before we
 * insert the new character.
 *
 * On a terminal like a CONCEPT our strategy is to make all
 * blanks be displayed, while trying to keep the screen having ``spaces''
 * for portions of tabs.  In this way the terminal hardware does some
 * of the hacking for compression of tabs, although this tends to
 * disappear as you work on the line and spaces change into blanks.
 *
 * There are a number of boundary conditions (like typing just before
 * the first following tab) where we can avoid a lot of work.  Most
 * of them have to be dealt with explicitly because performance is
 * much, much worse if we don't.
 *
 * A final thing which is hacked here is two flavors of insert mode.
 * Datamedia's do this by an insert mode which you enter and leave
 * and by having normal motion character operate differently in this
 * mode, notably by having a newline insert a line on the screen in
 * this mode.  This generally means it is unsafe to move around
 * the screen ignoring the fact that we are in this mode.
 * This is possible on some terminals, and wins big (e.g. HP), so
 * we encode this as a ``can move in insert capability'' mi,
 * and terminals which have it can do insert mode with much less
 * work when tabs are present following the cursor on the current line.
