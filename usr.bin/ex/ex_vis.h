 * Open and visual mode definitions.
 * 
 * There are actually 4 major states in open/visual modes.  These
 * are visual, crt open (where the cursor can move about the screen and
 * the screen can scroll and be erased), one line open (on dumb glass-crt's
 * like the adm3), and hardcopy open (for everything else).
 *
 * The basic state is given by bastate, and the current state by state,
 * since we can be in pseudo-hardcopy mode if we are on an adm3 and the
 * line is longer than 80.

 * The current window (which may have grown from the basic size)
 * has top WTOP and WLINES lines.  The top line of the window is WTOP,
 * and the bottom line WBOT.  The line WECHO is used for messages,
 * search strings and the like.  If WBOT==WECHO then we are in ONEOPEN
 * or HARDOPEN and there is no way back to the line we were on if we
 * go to WECHO (i.e. we will have to scroll before we go there, and
 * we can't get back).  There are WCOLS columns per line.
 * If WBOT!=WECHO then WECHO will be the last line on the screen

 * putting out @'s or ~'s on empty lines.
 *
 * HOLDDOL prevents the reopen routine from putting a '$' at the
 * end of a reopened line in list mode (for hardcopy mode, e.g.).
 *
 * HOLDROL prevents spurious blank lines when scrolling in hardcopy
 * open mode.
 *
 * HOLDQIK prevents the fake insert mode during repeated commands.
 *
 * HOLDPUPD prevents updating of the physical screen image when
 * mucking around while in insert mode.
 *
 * HOLDECH prevents clearing of the echo area while rolling the screen
 * backwards (e.g.) in deference to the clearing of the area at the
 * end of the scroll (1 time instead of n times).  The fact that this
 * is actually needed is recorded in heldech, which says that a clear
 * of the echo area was actually held off.
