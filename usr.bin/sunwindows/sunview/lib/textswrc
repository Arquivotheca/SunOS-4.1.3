# lower case characters, convert everything to lower case.
#       Example: EDIT TOOL => edit tool. 
# If there are any lower case letters, convert everything to uppercase.
#       Example: adjust_pending_delete => ADJUST_PENDING_DELETE

# If characters consist of several words separated by whitespace, then for each
# word, capitalize the first letter it if it isn't, lower case if it is.

# NOTE: Keys R8, R10, R12 and R14 are the arrow keys.
#        By default these emit cursor motion escape sequences (used e.g. by vi)
#        so their key mappings will not have any effect unless you 
#        set Arrow_Keys in the Input category of defaults to "No"
#        or run 'setkeys reset'.

# shift_lines shifts selected lines left the indicated number of tab
# stops, with tab stops computed the following way: if any spaces are
# seen on the first line, tab stops = 4. Otherwise, look in .indent.pro
# for corresponding value (you can use indent_defaults to set up your
# .indent.pro). If no .indent.pro, assume 8. Note this means that the
# user can specify 8 in his .indent.pro, but still have shift_lines do
# the right thing for those files that he has explicitly formatted using
# 4 space indentation, provided that the first line given to shift_lines
# contains some spaces.
