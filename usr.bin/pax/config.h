 * DEF_AR_FILE - tar only (required)

 * on those systems that don't have tape drives.
 */

/*
 * TTY - device which interactive queries should be directed to (required)
 *
 * This is the device to which interactive queries will be sent to and
 * received from.  On most unix systems, this should be /dev/tty, however, on
 * some systems, such as MS-DOS, it my need to be different (e.g. "con:").

 * PAXDIR - if you do not have directory access routines

 * as a system library or you wish to use the version supplied with PAX.

 * some systems.  Most define it to be off_t, but some define it to be long.

 * int, otherwise, it should be left undefined.
 *
 * For ANSI Systems this should always be blank.
