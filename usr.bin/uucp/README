		during the installation procedure.

Some useful shells:
Uutry:		shell for debugging--starts uucico with debugging option
Cvt:		shell to move C. and D. files from /usr/spool/uucp to proper
		place for the new directory structure
SetUp		shell that copies old system files to the
		new places (L.sys etc)
		NOTE - this will be
		automatically run during installation

Here are some pointers for converting to the new version:

1- There are some significant changes in L.sys  (new name = Systems) format.
    a-	For direct lines, the first device specification is changed
	from "ttyxx" to "Direct"
    b-	On time fields where the default wait time was specified,
	the ',' must be changed to a ';'
	In addition, the time has a slightly different meaning.
	The retry algorithm is now an exponential backoff with initial
	time (RETRYTIME in parms.h) and max retrytime (MAXRETRYTIME in
	parms.h).  If the ;time field is specified, that will always
	be the retry time.  If it is not given, the backoff will be used.
   (SEE Basic Networking Utilities - release 1 # 307-165 for details)

2- The L-devices (new name=Devices) file must also be changed.
    a-	All ACU lines must have "801" or the name of the modem
	(for example, penril) added to the end of the line.
    b-	All DIR lines must have "DIR" changed to "Direct"
	and the work 'direct' added to the line.
    See the comments in the Devices file delivered with the source.
   (SEE Basic Networking Utilities - release 1 # 307-165 for details)

3- The uucico program no longer searches for a system to call, it
   must be called with a -s option.  A new program, uusched,
   does the search for work and calls remotes in random order,
   by invoking uucico with -sSYSTEM option.  (see uudemon.hour)

Cron entries should be put into crontab for the demons. For example

39,9 * * * * /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.hour" > /dev/null
10 * * * * /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.poll" > /dev/null
45 23 * * * ulimit 5000; /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.cleanup" > /dev/null
48 10,14 * * 1-5 /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.admin" > /dev/null

Note - It is best to run these demons from the root cron file.
At a minimum, the uudemon.cleanup entry must be started as root since it must
invoke a 'ulimit' command.



For building the system:
1- Carefully go through the parms.h file to set it up for your
   environment.
  (SEE Basic Networking Utilities - release 1 # 307-165 for details)

2- During installation, a Permissions file will be created
   if one does not already exist.
   It will also make the needed directories, create some files in
   /usr/lib/uucp and install the uudemons.

3- The demons also send mail to someone (default uucp).  Change as
   desired.


Other misc:
0- SEE Basic Networking Utilities - release 1 # 307-165 
   to learn how to set up the Permissions file.
   A default one will be created by make install.
