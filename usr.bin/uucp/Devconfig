#
#	Devconfig provides a means of configuring STREAMS devices
#	by service.
#
#	FORMAT:
#
#	service=<service name>	device=<device type> \
#				push=<STREAMS module list>
#
#	where service name is "uucico" or "cu", device type is the device or
#	caller type (3rd field in Systems file, 1st field in Devices file),
#	and STREAMS module list is a colon-separated list of STREAMS modules
#	to be pushed on this stream.
#
#	The examples below are for the STARLAN NETWORK and assume that both
#	cu & uucico are going through login and so need full tty capabilities.
#	If uucico connects to a uucico server on the remote machine without
#	going through login, you would need to push only tirdwr.
#
#	EXAMPLE:
#		service=cu	device=STARLAN	push=ntty:tirdwr:ld0
#		service=uucico	device=STARLAN	push=ntty:tirdwr:ld0
#
#	Note: The tirdwr module is part of the NSU package.  Other 
#	modules needed to provide tty capabilities must be supplied by the
#	network provider.
