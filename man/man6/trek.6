Valid responses are \*(lqshort\*(rq, \*(lqmedium\*(rq, and \*(lqlong\*(rq.
You may also type \*(lqrestart\*(rq, which restarts a previously saved game.
You will then be prompted for the skill, to which you must respond
\*(lqnovice\*(rq, \*(lqfair\*(rq, \*(lqgood\*(rq, \*(lqexpert\*(rq,
\*(lqcommodore\*(rq, or \*(lqimpossible\*(rq.
You should normally start out with a novice and work up.

the game will tell you what it expects if you just type in a question mark.
