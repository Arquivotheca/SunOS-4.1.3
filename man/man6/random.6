.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "random game" "" "\fLrandom\fP game"
.LP
.B random
acts as a text filter, randomly selecting lines 
from its standard input
to write to the standard output.  The probability 
that a given line is
selected is normally 1/2; if a
.I divisor
is specified, it is treated as a floating-point number, and the
probability is
.RI 1/ divisor
instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-e
Don't read the standard input or write to the standard output.
Instead, exit with a random exit status between 0 and 1, or between 0
and
.IR divisor -1
if
.I divisor
is specified.
.TP
.B \-r
Don't buffer the output.  If
.B \-r
is not used, output is buffered in blocks, or
line-buffered if the standard output is a terminal.
