.TH BANNER 6 "16 February 1988"
.SH NAME
banner \- print large banner on printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/banner
[
.BI \-w n
]
message .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "banner" "large banner" "\fLbanner\fP" ""
.LP
.B banner
prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.
If the message is omitted, it prompts for and
reads one line of its standard input.  If
.B \-w
is given, the output is reduced from a width of 132 to
.IR n ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.  If
.I n
is omitted, it defaults to 80.
.LP
The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, 
up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages. The volume is enough that you want
a printer or a fast hardcopy terminal, but if you are patient, a
decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.
.SH BUGS
Several 
.SM ASCII 
characters are not defined, notably `<', `>', `[', `]', `\\',
`^', `_', `{', `}', `|', and `~'. 
Also, the characters `"', `'', and `&' are funny
looking (but in a useful way.)
.LP
The
.B \-w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
