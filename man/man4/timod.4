.SH NAME
timod \- Transport Interface cooperating STREAMS module
.SH CONFIG
.B pseudo-device  tim64
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B timod
is a
.SM STREAMS
module for use with the Transport Interface (\s-1TI\s+1)
functions of the Network Services library (see Section 3). 
The
.B timod
module converts a set of
.BR ioctl (2)
calls into
.SM STREAMS
messages that may be consumed by a transport protocol
provider which supports the Transport Interface.
This allows a user to initiate certain
.SM TI
functions as atomic operations.
.LP
The
.B timod
module must be pushed
onto only a
.I stream
terminated by a transport protocol provider which supports the
.SM TI\s0.
.LP
All
.SM STREAMS
messages, with the exception of the message
types generated from the
.B ioctl(\|)
commands described below, are transparently
passed to the neighboring
.SM STREAMS
module or driver.
The messages generated from the following
.B ioctl(\|)
commands are recognized and processed by the
.B timod
module.
The format of the
.B ioctl(\|)
call is:
.LP
.RE
.LP
Where, on issuance,
.B size
is the size of the appropriate
.SM TI
message to be sent to the transport provider and on
return
.B size
is the size of the appropriate
.SM TI\s0
message
from the transport provider in response to the issued
.SM TI
message.
.B buf
is a pointer to a buffer large enough to hold
the contents of the appropriate
.SM TI
messages.
The
.SM TI
message types are defined in
.BR <sys/tihdr.h> .
The possible values for the
.B cmd
field are:
.TP 20
.SM TI_BIND
Bind an address to the underlying transport protocol provider.
The message issued to the
.SM TI_BIND
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to
the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_BIND_REQ
and the message returned by the successful
completion of the
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_BIND_ACK\s0.
.TP
.SM TI_UNBIND
Unbind an address from the underlying transport protocol provider.
The message issued to the
.SM TI_UNBIND
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to
the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_UNBIND_REQ
and the message returned by the successful
completion of the
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_OK_ACK\s0.
.TP
.SM TI_GETINFO
Get the
.SM TI
protocol specific
information from the transport protocol provider.
The message issued to the
.SM TI_GETINFO
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_INFO_REQ
and the message returned by the successful
completion of the
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_INFO_ACK\s0.
.TP
.SM TI_OPTMGMT
Get, set or negotiate protocol specific options
with the transport protocol provider.
The message issued to the
.SM TI_OPTMGMT
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to
the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_OPTMGMT_REQ
and the message returned by the successful
completion of the
.B ioctl(\|)
is equivalent to the
.SM TI
message type
.SM T_OPTMGMT_ACK\s0.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
If the
.B ioctl(\|)
system call returns with a value greater than 0, the
lower 8 bits of the return value will
be one of the
.SM TI
error codes as defined in
.BR <sys/tiuser.h> .
If the
.SM TI
error is of type
.SM TSYSERR\s0,
then the next 8 bits of the return
value will contain an error as defined in
.B <sys/errno.h>
(see
.BR intro (2)).
