.LP
This Sun interface to the Versatec printer/plotter and to Centronics
printers is supported by the Systech parallel interface board,
an output-only byte-wide
.SM DMA
device.
The device has one channel for Versatec devices and one channel for Centronics
devices, with an optional long lines interface for Versatec devices.
.LP
Devices attached to this interface are normally handled by the line
printer spooling system and should not be accessed by the user directly.
.LP
Opening the device
.B /dev/vpc0
or
.B /dev/lp0
may yield one of two errors:
.SM ENXIO
indicates that the device is already in use;
.SM EIO
indicates that the device is offline.
.LP
The Versatec printer/plotter operates in either print or plot mode.
To set the printer into plot mode you should include
.B <sys/vcmd.h>
and use the
.BR ioctl (2)
call:
.LP
.RS
.B ioctl(f, \s-1VSETSTATE\s0, plotmd);
.RE
.LP
where
.I plotmd
is defined to be
.LP
.RS
.B
int plotmd[\|] = { \s-1VPLOT\s0, 0, 0 };
.RE
.LP
When going back into print mode from plot mode you normally eject
paper by sending it an
.SM EOT
after putting into print mode:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ft B
int prtmd[\|] = { \s-1VPRINT\s0, 0, 0 };
\&.\|.\|.
fflush (vpc);
f = fileno(vpc);
ioctl(f, \s-1VSETSTATE\s0, prtmd);
write(f, "\e04", 1);

.SH BUGS
.LP
If you use the standard I/O library on the Versatec, be sure to explicitly
set a buffer using
.BR setbuf (3V),
since the library will not use
buffered output by default, and will run very slowly.
