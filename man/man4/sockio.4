.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "socket I/O, see \fLsockio\fP(4)"
.IX I/O "socket, see \fLsockio\fP(4)"
.LP
The
.SM IOCTL\s0's
listed in this manual page apply directly to sockets, independent of any
underlying protocol.
Note: the
.B setsockopt
system call (see
.BR getsockopt (2))
is the primary method for operating on sockets as such, rather
than on the underlying protocol or network interface.
.BR ioctl s
for a specific network interface or protocol are documented in the
manual page for that interface or protocol.
.TP 20
.SB SIOCSPGRP
The argument is a pointer to an
.BR int .
Set the process-group ID that will subsequently receive
.SB SIGIO
or
.SB SIGURG
signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to
.B ioctl
to the value of that
.BR int .
.TP 20
.SB SIOCGPGRP
The argument is a pointer to an
.BR int .
Set the value of that
.B int
to the process-group
.SM ID
that is receiving
.SB SIGIO
or
.SB SIGURG
signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to
.BR ioctl .
.TP 20
.SB SIOCCATMARK
The argument is a pointer to an
.BR int .
Set the value of that
.B int
to 1 if the read pointer for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed
to
.B ioctl
points to a mark in the data stream for an out-of-band message, and to 0 if it
does not point to a mark.
