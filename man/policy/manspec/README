@(#)README 1.1 92/07/30 SMI;

This directory contains troff sources for the Man Page Specification
(manspec).

The Makefile in this directory is a pain.

You need /usr/doctools/bin/troff to format this document, so mount this
directory on a /usr/doctools host:

doctoolshost% su
Password:
doctoolshost# mount -o ro,soft argon:/usr/src/man/policy/manspec _mount-point_
doctoolshost# ^D

From there, print the document:

doctoolshost% cd _mount-point_
doctoolshost% make print

"make" and "make print" put a formatted version (ditroff output) of the
manspec in /tmp/manspec.dit which can be printed using "lpr -n".
"make clean" removes /tmp/manspec.dit.
