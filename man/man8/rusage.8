.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B rusage
command is similar to
.BR time (1V).
It runs the given
.IR command ,
which must be specified; that is,
.I command
is not optional as it is in the C shell's timing facility.
When the command is complete,
.B rusage
displays the real (wall clock), the system
.SM CPU\s0,
and the user
.SM CPU
times which elapsed during execution of the command,
plus other fields in the
.B rusage
structure, all on one long line.
Times are reported in seconds and hundredths of a second.
