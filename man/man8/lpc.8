lpc \- line printer control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/etc/lpc
[

[
.IR parameter .\|.\|.
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "lpc command"  ""  "\fLlpc\fP \(em line printer control"
.IX  "control line printer"  ""  "control line printer \(em \fLlpc\fP" ""  PAGE START
.IX  "line printer control"  ""  "line printer control \(em \fLlpc\fP" ""  PAGE START
.IX  printer "control \(em \fLlpc\fP"
.LP
.B lpc
controls the operation of the printer, or of multiple printers,
as described in the
.B /etc/printcap
database.
.B lpc
commands can be used to start or stop a printer, disable or enable
a printer's spooling queue, rearrange the order of jobs in a queue,
or display the status of each printer\(em\&along with its
spooling queue and printer daemon.
.LP
With no arguments,
.B lpc
runs interactively, prompting with
.BR lpc> .
If arguments are supplied,
.BR lpc
interprets the first as a
.IR command
to execute; each subsequent argument is taken as a
.I parameter
for that command.
The standard input can be redirected so that
.B lpc
reads commands from a file.
.SH USAGE
.SS Commands
Commands may be abbreviated to an unambiguous substring.  Note: the
.I printer
parameter is specified just by the name of the printer (as
.BR  lw ),
not as you would specify it to
.BR lpr (1)
or
.BR lpq (1)
(not as
.BR  \-Plw ).

.IX  "abort printer"  ""  "abort printer \(em \fLlpc\fP"
Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
.BR lpr (1))
for the specified printers.  The
.B abort
command can only be used by the super-user.

Remove all files with names beginning with

.IX  "down, take printer"  ""  "down, take printer \(em \fLlpc\fP"
Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
.I message
in the printer status file. The message doesn't need to be
quoted, the
remaining arguments are treated like
.BR echo (1V).
This is normally used to take a printer down and let others know why
.RB ( lpq (1)
indicates that the printer is down, as does the
.B status
command).
