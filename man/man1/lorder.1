.SH NAME
lorder \- find an ordering relation for an object library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lorder
.IR filename .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "lorder command"  ""  "\fLlorder\fP \(em find ordering for object library"
.IX  find "ordering for object library"  ""  "find ordering for object library \(em \fLlorder\fP"
.IX  library  "find ordering for object"  ""  "find ordering for object \(em \fLlorder\fP"
.IX  "object library, find ordering for"  ""  "object library, find ordering for \(em \fLlorder\fP"
.IX  "programming tools"  "lorder"  ""  "\fLlorder\fP \(em find ordering for object library"
.LP
Give
.B lorder
one or more object or library archive (see
.BR ar (1V))
.IR filename s,
and it lists
pairs of object file names \(em
meaning that the first file of the pair refers to
external identifiers defined in
the second \(em to the standard output.
.BR lorder 's
output may be processed by
.BR  tsort (1)
to find an ordering of
a library suitable for one-pass access by
.BR  ld (1).
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This brash one-liner intends to build a new library from existing
.B .o
files.
.IP
.B
ar cr library \`\|lorder *.o | tsort\`
.LP
The
.BR ranlib (1),
command converts an ordered archive
into a randomly accessed library and makes
.B lorder
unnecessary.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ar (1V),
.BR ld (1),
.BR ranlib (1),
.BR tsort (1)
.SH BUGS
The names of object files, in and out of
libraries, must end with
.RB  ` .o ';
otherwise, nonsense results.
