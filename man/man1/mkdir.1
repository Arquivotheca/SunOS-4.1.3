.B mkdir
creates directories.
Standard entries,
.RB ` . ',
for the directory itself, and
.RB ` .\|. '
for its parent, are made automatically.
.LP
The 
.B \-p
flag allows missing parent directories to be created as needed.
.LP
With the exception of the
.B set-gid
bit, the current
.BR umask (2V)
setting determines the mode in which directories
are created.
The new directory inherits the
.B set-gid
bit of the parent directory.
Modes may
be modified after creation by using
.BR chmod (1V).
.LP
.B mkdir
requires write permission in the parent directory.
