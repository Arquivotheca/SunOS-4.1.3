.\"Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.\".B cd
.\"would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command.  It is therefore
.\"recognized and executed by the shells. 
In
.BR csh (1)
you may specify a list of directories in which
.I directory
is to be sought as a subdirectory if it is not a subdirectory of the
current directory; see the description of the
