.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  semctl()  "" "\fLsemctl()\fR \(em semaphore controls"
.IX  semaphore "control \(em \fLsemctl()\fR"
.B semctl(\|)
provides a variety of semaphore control operations as specified by
.IR cmd .
.LP
The following
.IR cmd s
are executed with respect to the semaphore specified by
.IR semid " and " semnum:
.TP 15
.SB GETVAL
Return the value of
.I semval
(see
.BR intro (2)).
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.TP
.SB SETVAL
Set the value of
.I semval
to
.IR arg.val .
.B [\s-1ALTER\s0]
When this cmd is successfully executed, the
.I semadj
value corresponding to the
specified semaphore in all processes is cleared.
.TP
.SB GETPID
Return the value of
.IR sempid .
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.TP
.SB GETNCNT
Return the value of
.IR semncnt .
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.TP
.SB GETZCNT
Return the value of
.IR semzcnt .
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.LP
The following
.IR cmd s
return and set, respectively, every
.I semval
in the set of semaphores.
.TP 15
.SB GETALL
Place
.I semvals
into the array pointed to by
.IR arg.array .
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.TP
.SB SETALL
Set
.I semvals
according to the array pointed to by
.IR arg.array .
.B [\s-1ALTER\s0]
When this cmd is successfully executed the
.I semadj
values corresponding to each
specified semaphore in all processes are cleared.
.LP
The following
.IR cmd s
are also available:
.TP 15
.SB IPC_STAT
Place the current value of each member of the data structure associated with
.I semid
into the structure pointed to by
.IR arg.buf .
The contents of this structure are defined in
.BR intro (2).
.B [\s-1READ\s0]
.TP
.SB IPC_SET
Set the value of the following members of the data structure associated with
.I semid
to the corresponding value found in the structure pointed to by
.IR arg.buf :
.RS
.IP
.ft B
sem_perm.uid
.br
sem_perm.gid
.br
sem_perm.mode /\(** only low 9 bits \(**/
.ft
.RE
.IP
This
.I cmd
can only be executed by a process that has an effective user
.SM ID
equal to either that of super-user, or to the value of
.B sem_perm.cuid
or
.B sem_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with
.IR semid .
.br
.ne 5
.TP 15
.SB IPC_RMID
Remove the semaphore identifier specified by
.I semid
from the system and destroy the set of semaphores and data structure
associated with it.
This cmd can only be executed by a process that has an effective user
.SM ID
equal to either that of super-user, or to the value of
.B sem_perm.cuid
or
.B sem_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with
.IR semid .
.br
.ne 12
.LP
In the
.BR semop (2)
and 
.BR semctl (2)
system call descriptions, the permission required
for an operation is given as "[token]", where \*(lqtoken\*(rq is the type
of permission needed interpreted as follows:
.LP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 28
00400
Read by user
.TP
00200
Alter by user
.TP
00060
Read, Alter by group
.TP
00006
Read, Alter by others
.RE
.PD
.LP
Read and Alter permissions on a semid are
granted to a process if one or more of the following are true:
.IP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process is super-user.
.IP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process matches
.B sem_perm.[c]uid
in the data structure associated with
.I semid
and the appropriate bit of the
\*(lquser\*(rq portion (0600) of
.B sem_perm.mode
is set.
.IP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process does not match
.B sem_perm.[c]uid
and the effective group
.SM ID
of the process matches
.B sem_perm.[c]gid
and the appropriate bit of the \*(lqgroup\*(rq portion
(060) of
.B sem_perm.mode
is set.
.IP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process does not match
.B sem_perm.[c]uid
and the effective group
.SM ID
of the process does not match
.B sem_perm.[c]gid
and the appropriate bit of the \*(lqother\*(rq portion (06) of
.B sem_perm.mode
is set.
.LP
Otherwise, the corresponding permissions are denied.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
On success,
the value returned
by
.B semctl(\|)
depends on
.I cmd
as follows:
.TP 15
.SM GETVAL
The value of
.IR semval .
.TP
.SM GETPID
The value of
.IR sempid .
.TP
.SM GETNCNT
The value of
.IR semncnt .
.TP
.SM GETZCNT
The value of
.IR semzcnt .
.TP
All others
0.
.LP
On failure,
.B semctl(\|)
returns
\-1
and sets
.B errno
to indicate the error.
