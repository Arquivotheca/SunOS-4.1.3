.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vadvise(\|)
is used to inform the system that process paging behavior merits
special consideration.  Parameters to
.B vadvise(\|)
are defined in the file
.BR <sys/vadvise.h >.
Currently, two calls to
.B vadvise(\|)
are implemented.
.IP
.BR vadvise(\s-1VA_ANOM\s0) ;
.LP
advises that the paging behavior is not likely to be well handled by the
system's default algorithm, since reference information that is collected over
macroscopic intervals (for instance, 10-20 seconds) will not serve to indicate future
page references.  The system in this case will choose to replace
pages with little emphasis placed on recent usage, and more emphasis
on referenceless circular behavior.  It is
.I essential
that processes which have very random paging behavior (such as
.SM LISP
during garbage collection of very large address spaces) call
.BR vadvise ,
as otherwise the system has great difficulty dealing with their
page-consumptive demands.
.IP
.BR vadvise(\s-1VA_NORM\s0) ;
.LP
restores default paging replacement behavior after a call to
.IP
.BR vadvise(\s-1VA_ANOM\s0) ;
.SH BUGS
The current implementation of
.B vadvise(\|)
will go away soon, being replaced by a per-page
.B vadvise(\|)
facility.
