.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B void
.B swab(from, to, nbytes)
.B char *from, *to;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B swab(\|)
copies
.I nbytes
bytes pointed to by
.I from
to the position pointed to by
.IR to ,
exchanging adjacent even and odd bytes.
It is useful for carrying binary data between
high-ender machines (\s-1IBM\s0
360's,
.SM MC\s068000's,
etc) and low-end machines (such as Sun386i systems).
.LP
.I nbytes
should be even and positive.
If
.I nbytes
is odd and positive,
.B swab(\|)
uses
.IR nbytes " \- 1"
instead.
If
.I nbytes
is negative,
.B swab(\|)
does nothing.
.LP
The
.I from
and
.I to
addresses should not overlap in portable programs.
