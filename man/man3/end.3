.IX  "last locations in program"
.IX  "end locations in program"
.IX  "end location"  ""  "\fLend()\fP \(em end of program"
.IX  "etext location"  ""  "\fLetext()\fP \(em end of program text"
.IX  "edata location"  ""  "\fLedata()\fP \(em end of program data"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These names refer neither to routines nor to locations with interesting
contents.  The address of
.I etext
is the first address above the program text,
.I edata
above the initialized data region, and
.B end(\|)
above the uninitialized data region.
.LP
When execution begins, the program break (the first location beyond the data)
coincides with
.BR end ,
but it is reset by the routines
.BR brk (2),
.BR malloc (3V),
standard input/output
.RB ( stdio (3V)),
the profile
.RB ( \-p )
option of
.BR cc (1V),
and so on.
Thus, the current value of the program break
should be determined by
.B sbrk(0)
(see
.BR brk (2)).
