.SH NAME
yppasswd \- NIS password file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/yppasswd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "yppasswd" "" "\fLyppasswd\fP\(em NIS password file" ""
.LP
Create the
Network Information Service
(\s-1NIS\s0)
password map with this text file.
The format for
.B /etc/yppasswd
is the same as for the
.B /etc/passwd
file described in
.BR passwd (5).
.LP
The text file for the 
.SM NIS
password map is stored in the
.B /etc/passwd
file on the 
.SM NIS
master of an
.SM NIS
domain. 
Other systems in a domain can also have a local
.B /etc/passwd
file.
The local file is accessed first by programs such as
.BR passwd (1),
and if it contains a line beginning with the character
.RB ` + ',
the 
.SM NIS
map will be accessed.
.LP
The local
.B /etc/passwd
file can specify users that are not available on a
network-wide basis.
This implies that the 
.SM NIS
master cannot use the local
.B /etc/passwd
file to specify users that are to be
known only to the local system.
Sun386i systems allow the
.BR /etc/passwd
file on the 
.SM NIS
master to be used locally, creating the
.SM NIS
password map from the
.B /etc/yppasswd
text file.
