.TH PRIMES 6 "17 March 1987"
.SH NAME
primes \- print all primes larger than some given number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/primes
[
.I number
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I primes
reads a number from the standard input and
prints all primes larger than the given number.  If
.I number
is given as an argument, it uses that number rather than reading one
from the standard input.
.SH BUGS
It obviously cannot print
.I all
primes larger than some given number.  It will not behave very
sensibly when it overflows an
.BR int .
