.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Filemerge
is a window-based version of
.IR diff (1),
for comparing and merging text files.  It displays two files
for side-by-side comparison, each in a read-only text-subwindow.
Beneath them, an editing subwindow can be used to construct a
\fImerged\fP
version\(em\&one which contains selected lines from
either or both input files, along with any additional edits you may
make.
.LP
.I leftfile
and
.I rightfile
are the files to be compared, and
.I outfile
is name of the file containing the merged version.  If
.I outfile
is a directory, then the output is placed in the file
.IR outfile/leftfile .
If 
.I outfile
is omitted, the output file is named
.B filemerge.\|out
by default.  If no filename
arguments are given, you can enter them from within the tool itself.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a " ancestor"
Compare both files with respect to
.IR ancestor .
A minus-sign indicates lines that have been deleted relative to the
ancestor.  A plus-sign indicates
lines added relative to the ancestor.
.TP
.B \-b
Ignore leading blanks in comparisons.
.TP
.BI \-l " listfile"
Process a list of filename pairs.  With this option,
.I leftfile
and
.I rightfile
are the names of directories, and
.I listfile
contains a list of filenames that appear in both.
.I filemerge
compares the versions of each file between the two
directories, and allows you to create a merged version (typically
in the directory
.IR outfile ).
The
.B
.SM SHIFT\*S\-Load
command button, which is selected by holding the 
.SM SHIFT
key while clicking on the
.B Load
button, reads in the next pair named in the list.
If
.I listfile
is 
.BR \- ,
then the list of files is read from the standard input.
.TP
.B \-r
Readonly mode.  Don't display the editing subwindow.
.SH USAGE
.LP
The text in the editing subwindow
.RI ( outfile )
is initially the same as that in
.IR leftfile .
To construct a merged version, you can directly edit the text of
.I outfile
with textedit commands, or you can change
a selected difference to match
.I rightfile
(the one on the right) by clicking the
\fBRight\fP
button in the top panel.
.SS Differences
At any given time, one of the displayed ``differences'' is
\fIcurrent\fP.
The current difference is indicated by emboldening the
symbol adjacent to each line, and also by the notation
``\fIi\ \fBof\ \fIn\fR\|'' displayed in the control panel.  Once a
difference is current, you can use the
\fBLeft\fP
and
\fBRight\fP
buttons to apply either the left-hand or
the right-hand version of the text to
.IR outfile .
The
.B Next
and 
.B Prev
buttons select the next or previous difference, respectively.
.SS Property Sheet
You can customize
\fIfilemerge\fP
using the property sheet to
set or alter various display and control options.  To bring up
the property sheet, press the
.B Props
function key (typically
.BR L3 )
while the mouse is over any part of filemerge.
.SS "Menus"
There are pop-up menus associated with several of the control panel
items, and a menu associated with the editing subwindow.  The former
provide to select any command function obtained with a modified
mouse-button (such as 
.B
.SM SHIFT\*S\-Next\c
); the editing subwindow's menu has items that
control the filename and directory location of the merged output.  To
bring up a menu, move the mouse-cursor
to the command button, or to the
editing subwindow, and hold down the right mouse-button.  Select a
desired menu item by releasing the
mouse-button after moving the cursor
on top of it.
.SS "Command Buttons"
.IP \fBNext\fP 12
Make the next difference current.  The
subwindow scrolls, if necessary, to display it.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT-\fBNext\fP 
12
Make the first difference current.  (Also a menu item from the 
.B Next
menu.)
.IP \fBPrev\fP
Make the previous difference current.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT\s0-Prev\fR 
12
Make the last difference current.
(Also a menu item from the 
.B Prev
menu.)
.IP \fBRight\fP
Apply right-hand version of the current difference to 
.IR outfile .
If
\fBautoadvance\fP
is in effect, advance to the next difference.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT\s0-Right\fP 
12
Apply the right-hand version and advance
to the next difference, unless
.B autoadvance
is in effect.
(Also a menu item from the 
.B Right
menu.)
.IP \fB\s-1CTRL\s0-Right\fP
Apply the right-hand version for the current difference, and
for all subsequent differences up to the end of the file.
.IP \fBLeft\fP
Apply the left-hand version of the current difference.
.IP \fBUndo\fP
Undo the last
\fBRight\fP
or
\fBLeft\fP
operation.  You can undo
up to 100 stacked operations.  You can't undo an undo.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT\s0-Undo\fP 
12
Undo all the operations since the last
\fBLoad\fP,
or the last
100 operations.
.IP \fBScroll-Lock\fP
When in effect, the three text-subwindows scroll in unison.
Otherwise each subwindow scrolls independently.
.IP "\fIi \fBof \fIn\fR"
The number of the current difference,
.IR i ,
out of
.IR n
detected differences.
Popping up a menu on this item allows you to jump
to a selected difference.
.IP \fBLoad\fP 12
Load the files whose names appear by the prompts
\fBFile1:\fP
and
\fBFile2:\fP.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT\s0-Load\fP 
12
When the
.B \-l
option is used, load the files from the directories shown in
.B File1
and 
.B File2
corresponding to the next name in the list (taken from the
.I listfile
argument).
.IP \fBDone\fP
Save
\fIoutfile\fP
and close the tool.  The name used to save the
file appears in the namestripe, in the same fashion as textedit.
.IP \fB
\s-1SHIFT\s0-Done\fP 
12
Save without closing.  You can also save the merged version using
the
\fBSave\fP
item in the editing subwindow's menu.
.IP \fBQuit\fP
Exit the tool.  You must explictly save your merged 
.I outfile,
either with the
\fBDone\fP
button or the
\fBSave\fP
item in the
editing subwindow's menu.
.SS Properties
.LP
Hitting the
.B L3

The property panel items have the following meanings:
.LP
