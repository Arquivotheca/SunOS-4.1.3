as might be found in Reno.
The following rules apply:
.HP 5

.IP
A player ``natural'' (black jack) pays $3.
A dealer natural loses $2.
Both dealer and player naturals
is a ``push'' (no money exchange).
.IP
If the dealer has an ace up,
the player is allowed to make an ``insurance''
bet against the chance of a dealer natural.
If this bet is not taken, play resumes as normal.
If the bet is taken, it is a side bet
where the player wins $2 if the dealer has
a natural and loses $1 if the dealer does not.
.IP
If the player is dealt two cards
of the same value, he is allowed to
``double''.
He is allowed to play two
hands, each with one of these cards.
(The bet is doubled also; $2 on each hand.)
.IP
If a dealt hand
has a total of ten or eleven,
the player may ``double down''.
He may double the bet ($2 to $4)
and receive exactly one more card on that hand.
.IP
Under normal play,
the player may ``hit'' (draw a card)
as long as his total is not over twenty-one.
If the player ``busts'' (goes over twenty-one),
the dealer wins the bet.
.IP
When the player ``stands'' (decides not to hit),
the dealer hits until he attains
a total of seventeen or more.
