.SH NAME
coretool, view_surface \- obsolete commands 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I coretool
is an obsolete program, sometimes invoked by SunCore or CGI
programs to create a window for a view surface.  It is used only
by binaries compiled under the 1.x or 2.x Sun releases.
.SH BUGS
.LP
.I coretool
is no longer intended to be run as a command.
.LP
If you type an EOF signal (^D) while in the 
.I coretool
window, this signal is passed along to the shell 
from which it is invoked.  If the shell is running in a
shelltool, and 
.B ignoreeof
is not set, the EOF signal may kill that shelltool window.
