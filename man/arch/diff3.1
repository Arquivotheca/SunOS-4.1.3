.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "diff3 command"  ""  "\fLdiff3\fP \(em three-way differential compare"
.IX files  "three-way differential compare"
.IX files  "compare three-way differential"
.IX compare  "three-way differential"
.I Diff3
compares three versions of a file,
and publishes disagreeing ranges of text
flagged with these codes:
.TP 16
====
all three files differ
.TP 16
====1
.IR file1 " is different"
.TP 16
====2
.IR file2 " is different"
.TP 16
====3
.IR file3 " is different"
.PP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range
of a given file to some other is
indicated in one of these ways:
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " a"
Text is to be appended after line number
.I n1
in file
.I f,
where
.I f
= 1, 2, or 3.
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " , " n2 " c"
Text is to be
changed in the range line
.I n1
to line
.IR n2 .
If 
.I n1
=
.I n2,
the range may be abbreviated to
.IR n1 .
.PP
The original contents of the range follows immediately
after a
.B c
indication.
When the contents of two
files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered
file is suppressed.
.PP
Under the
.B \-e
option,
.I diff3
publishes a script for the editor
.I ed
that will incorporate into
.I file1
all changes between
.I file2
and
.I file3,
.IR i.e .
the changes that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3.
Option
.B \-x
(\fB\-3\fR)
produces a script to incorporate
only changes flagged ==== (====3).
The following command will apply the resulting script to
`file1'.
