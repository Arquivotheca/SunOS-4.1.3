.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "backgammon command"  ""  "\fLbackgammon\fP \(em backgammon game"
.LP
.I Backgammon
lets you play backgammon against the computer or against a `friend'.
All commands only are one letter, so you don't need to type a carriage return,
except at the end of a move.
.I Backgammon
is mostly self documenting, so that a question mark (?) will usually get
some help.  If you answer `y' when
.I backgammon
asks if you want the rules, you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy, instruction on how to use
.I backgammon,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
A description of how to use
.I backgammon
can be obtained by answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.
.s3
The possible arguments for backgammon
(most are unnecesary but some are very convenient) consist of:
.TP
.B n

.TP
.B r
player is red (implies n)
.TP
.B w
player is white (implies n)
.TP
.B b

.TP
.B pr

.TP
.B pw

.IR term ,

.IR /etc/termcap ,
otherwise uses the
.SM TERM
environment variable.
.TP
.B s\fIfile
recover previously saved game from
.IR file .
This can also be done by executing the saved file,
that is, typing its name in as a command.
.LP
Arguments may be optionally preceded by a
.B \-
sign.  Several arguments may
be concatenated together, but not after `s' or `t' arguments, since
they can be followed by an arbitrary string.  Any unrecognized
arguments are ignored.  An argument of a lone
.B \-
gets a description of possible arguments.
.LP
If
.I term
has capabilities for direct cursor movement.
.I backgammon
`fixes' the board after each move, so the board does not need to be
reprinted, unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.  Also, any
`p' option will be ignored.
